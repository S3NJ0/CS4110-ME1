Alan Turing introduces the "Imitation Game" and now called the Turing Test. This test focuses on whether a machine can mimic human responses so well that you can’t tell it apart from an actual person. It’s a more down-to-earth way of approaching the idea of machine intelligence, moving away from abstract debates to something we can practically observe and measure.

What stands out about Turing’s work is how ahead of its time it was. He envisioned machines doing tasks we now take for granted, like understanding language or solving complex problems. His paper laid the foundation for the entire field of artificial intelligence, but it also raised deeper questions about the ethical and philosophical implications of creating thinking machines. Turing’s ability to combine scientific insight with philosophical thought makes his work a cornerstone in both technology and understanding what makes us human.
